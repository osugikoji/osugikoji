### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software engineer with a primary focus on Android development. Although my expertise lies in Android, I also possess experience in iOS development and backend programming using Java and Kotlin. I'm always ready to adapt to new technologies and explore different tech stacks.

Throughout my journey, I've had the opportunity to contribute to various open-source projects, leveraging my skills to make a positive impact on the developer community. Additionally, I have co-created the [@hexascribe](https://github.com/hexascribe) organization, which serves as a platform for me to create and share my own open-source projects.
